# *Bench Power Supply PCB*

This repo contains project files for a bench top power supply I designed for my home lab.

## *Requirements:*
* **Small** for crammed work spaces
* **Adjustable** and designed to **store values** on each power cycle
* **2 layer** board
* **Digitally controlled** - no mechanical parts
* Clear **annunciators**
* Uses an external AC-DC converter
* At least a **2A max** load
* Cover most logic levels
* *~ Possibly have preset buttons ~*
## Built With

* [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/) - Schematic capture and layout
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used to develop firmware
* [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview) - Used to design 3-D models for packages

### *Notes:*
- The PCB uses a 5/5mil DRC constraint
- The top of the PCB acts as the product face plate
- Non-standard footprint 3-D models have been provided in the STEP file format
